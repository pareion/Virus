Virus - The Game

The game have an NxN board where N is the board size and each player has a brick in the corner and then the player can either duplicate itself
to one of the nearest squares or "jump" to a square even further away but leaving the square it jumps from empty. The goal of the game
is to capture all the enemy squares or as many as possible.

I've build 4 agents which you can test the game on, Random player, Semi-smart player, MiniMax player and ANN player. 

Mainly this project was to help me understand how the agents is implemented in an environment I have build myself and trying to understand
how much work there actually goes into developing these agents.
